	<para>This will explain what is required to be done to add a directory into the FWPort CVS
	  repository. In the following example we want to add a newly created subdirectory of
	  FWPort\docs called "fwport_cvs_directory_addition" to CVS. This basically consists of doing an
	  import into CVS. Care has to be taken to import at the correct location as WinCVS will not
	  supply the required path automatically.</para>

	  <listitem>
		<para>Start WinCVS, ensure that Pageant is running and that your private key has been added
		  to Pageant.</para>

	  <listitem>
		<para>Right-click on the directory that needs to be added to CVS and select the "Import
		  module..." item.</para>

	  <listitem>
		<para>You will be presented by the following import filter. In most circumstances you simply
		  have to click "Continue". This dialog window indicates which files will be imported as
		  "TEXT" and which one will be imported as "BINARY" into CVS.</para>

	  <listitem>
		<para>In the "Import settings" tab of the "Import settings" window set the "Repository path"
		  to the same directory name prefixed by "projects/FieldWorks/". For example in our case
		  where the imported directory is:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
		  <listitem>
			<simpara>C:\FWPort\docs\fwport_cvs_directory_addition</simpara>
		  </listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>We would need to enter:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
		  <listitem>
			<simpara>projects/FieldWorks/docs/fwport_cvs_directory_addition</simpara>
		  </listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<mediaobject>
		  <imageobject>
			<imagedata fileref="../images/cvs_dir_add/import003.jpg"/>
		  </imageobject>
		</mediaobject>

		<para>
		  <note>
			<itemizedlist>
			  <listitem>
				<simpara>The "Vendor Tag" is an initial branch tag and the "Release tag" is a "tag"
				  tag.</simpara>
			  </listitem>

			  <listitem>
				<simpara>The path separators specified for the import repository location have to be
				  the Unix ones "/" and not the DOS ones "\".</simpara>
			  </listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		  </note>
		</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
		<simpara>In the "Import options" tab of the "Import settings" window check the "Create the
		  CVS directories while importing" checkbox.</simpara>

		<mediaobject>
		  <imageobject>
			<imagedata fileref="../images/cvs_dir_add/import004.jpg"/>
		  </imageobject>
		</mediaobject>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
		<para>Click "OK" to do the import process.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<note>
	  <simpara>From a remote location it was found that a more sure way to do an import when having
		problems getting the process completed is to import an empty directory structure with a
		small dummy text file in the deepest directory of each directory branch with no other files
		present. This will create the CVS directory structure and then you can add the files using
		the CVS add command rather than import. Once all of your files are added and committed you
		can then delete the dummy files. This is more tedious but was found to be necessary at
		times.</simpara>
